# Stamps and Coins Service

## How to startup

You can start this SpringBoot application without environment variables.
However, it will preferably use STACO_AWS_LOCALSTACK_IP as a variable to configure where localstack actually is.
You can also add STACO_AWS_LOCALSTACK_PORT to specify the port. It uses 4566 by default
